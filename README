VDD SPI voltage:
IO45: 0 = 3.3V, 1 = 1.8V

JTAG:
IO3:  0 = JTAG pins, 1 = USB Serial/JTAG

Reset:
The reset signal is driven by the reset button, Q101 via the serial
port RTS/DTR signals, and from the power good output of the 3.3V power supply.
The reset signal drives the reset inputs of the BNO085 motion controller,
the PCA9575 GPIO expander, and the ESP32 S3.  Note that IO2 can also reset
the BNO085 to support loading the bootloader from the ESP32.

Power:
All power is supplied at 5V from either J105, micro USB J104, or USB J102.
J105 is the preferred power source.  5V is converted to 3.3V by the
MPM3810GQB-33 module which provides up to 1.2A.  The power good signal from
this module drives the reset signal so the chip will not be brought out of
reset until after the 3.3V has stabilized.  The 12V supply can provide up to
1A and by default is disabled until IO46 is pulled high.  IO46 is low by
default since it is used for bootstrapping.  This is separate from the fan
PWM which is cointrolled by IO3.

While the board has been configured to handle at least 2A of power at 5V,
this board is not designed to provide power to a significant number of LEDs
or devices.  It is expected that they will have their own power supply with
a common ground.

Fans:
This board provides two outputs for fans.  The first, J201, provides 12V
without PWM support whenever IO46 is pulled high.  Connector J401 provides
both 5V and 12V and both supplies are modulated or controlled by GPIO IO3
which must be pulled high.  IO3 controls both 5V and 12V simultaneously.
The fan outputs have diodes to protect against any back EMF.  The 12V comes
from the same supply and is limited to 1 amp, however it is best to not test
this.

I2C:
The I2C bus uses 2.2K pull-up resistors instead of the more traditional 4.7
or 10K.  This is due to the fact that the i2c bus can be exported off of the
board and having stronger pull-ups should provide better signal integrity.
There are three interrupt lines that are supported.  Internally, i2c is
used by the GPIO expander, the motion sensor, and the I2S stereo audio
amplifier.

5V signalling:
Six GPIOs pass through open-collector level shifters with pull-up resistors.
These may be used to drive NeoPixels or other 5V devices and are
bi-directional.  All 5V I/Os also have a 33 ohm resistor in series to help
reduce reflections.

Status LED:
A WS2812 compatible status LED is present and is driven by IO21.  The output
of this LED may be used to drive additional LEDs and is connected to J103.

USB:
The USB is connected to the ESP32 controller after passing through a protection
and USB termination chip U101. USB can be used for JTAG and serial output.

Buttons:
Reset - Pulls the reset signal low
Prog - Pulls IO0 low to boot into programming mode.  Since IO0 is also the
INT signal it can be used to generate an interrupt at runtime.  Note that
INT is shared with the I2C GPIO expander.

I2C GPIO Expander:
A SX1509B provides 12 additional GPIO pins which may be configured for input
or output.  They can also be configured to generate an interrupt on the INT
signal (IO0).  The GPIO expander chip is also connected to the reset signal.
This particular GPIO expander has numerous features which may be of use.
It has support for driving LEDs and providing PWM and blink support.  Some
GPIO pins can also "breathe" where they will fade in and out.  Both logrithmic
and linear modes are supported.  It can also function as a keyboard scanner.
Each pin can be input or output, or open drain.  Pull-up and pull-down resistors
can also be configured.
Drive strength and slew rate can also be configured.
Interrupts can be generated on either the rising, falling, or both edges.

Motion Controller/Accelerometer:
A BNO085 9-axis accelerometer/gyroscope/compass/temperature sensor chip is
provided for tracking motion.  This chip performs all the necessary
calculations and offloads them from the ESP32.  It is connected via I2C and
INT2.  The boot loader pin is also connected to a GPIO pin.

Temperature/Pressure/Humidity:
A BME280 temperature, pressure, and humidity sensor is connected to the
secondary I2C bus of the BNO085.  The BNO085 will periodically poll this
and can use this to assist in detecting altitude.
